- Bug fixes:
  - Fixed an issue where a variable wouldn't get set during validation, making it impossible to continue (still experimenting with this)
  - Fixed an issue where the popup window for installation sometimes showed NaN in the loading bar
  - Fixed an issue where the popup window for installation sometimes wouldn't disappear when the bar was full
  - Fixed an issue where the popup window for installation sometimes wouldn't disappear due to a status bug not letting SAMMI listen to that event from the window
  - Fixed an issue where sando-helper.zip would not get destroyed upon extraction
  - Fixed an issue where sando helper was not properly waiting for a connection from SAMMI before setting itself as ready (async issue)
  - Fixed an issue where the websocket client on the bridge would duplicate when manually disconnecting and reconnecting the bridge
